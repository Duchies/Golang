if i have 10 gorouties fucntion of 100 line 
and I have 2 line which need atomic/ mutax [basically critical section ]


in this case which 
1) if I use atomic then will it block rest gorouteins 
2) if I use mutax lock then will it block the rest routiens 
?

You're asking a very important concurrency question ‚Äî let‚Äôs analyze both scenarios clearly. Your case is:

You have 10 goroutines, each running a 100-line function. Inside that function, only 2 lines require synchronization (a critical section).

Let‚Äôs break this down:

üîç Assumptions:
Critical section: updating a shared variable (e.g., counter, map, etc.).

The rest of the code (98 lines) is independent per goroutine.

You want to know if other goroutines are blocked while one is in the critical section.

üö¶Case 1: Using atomic
‚úÖ Behavior:
Atomic operations do not block other goroutines.

Each atomic call (like atomic.AddInt64) is a non-blocking CPU instruction.

Other goroutines continue executing their code, including their own atomic ops.

‚úÖ Example:
go
Copy
Edit
for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
    doHeavyStuff(i) // 98 lines
    atomic.AddInt64(&sharedCounter, 1) // 1 line critical section
}
‚úÖ Result:
All 10 goroutines run independently.

Atomic just ensures correctness, without blocking others.

You get max concurrency + correctness.

üö¶Case 2: Using sync.Mutex
‚ùó Behavior:
Only one goroutine can be inside mutex.Lock() at a time.

Other goroutines are blocked (parked) if they try to enter the critical section simultaneously.

‚ùó Example:
go
Copy
Edit
for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
    doHeavyStuff(i) // 98 lines
    mu.Lock()
    sharedCounter++
    mu.Unlock()
}
‚ö†Ô∏è Result:
While 98 lines run in parallel, the critical section is serialized.

If two goroutines hit mu.Lock() around the same time:

One proceeds

Others block (wait) until unlock

If contention is low (few goroutines hit the critical section at the same time), it's okay.

If contention is high, it becomes a bottleneck.

üîÑ Comparison Summary
Feature	atomic	mutex
Blocking	‚ùå Non-blocking	‚úÖ Blocking (others wait)
Critical section time	~nanoseconds (1 CPU instruction)	~micro-milliseconds (wait + lock)
Rest of goroutine blocked?	‚ùå No	‚ùå Only blocked at Lock() point
Concurrent goroutines safe	‚úÖ Yes	‚úÖ Yes
Performance	üöÄ Fast	üê¢ Slower under contention

‚úÖ Final Answer to Your Questions
‚ùì Q1: If I use atomic, will it block rest goroutines?
üÖ∞Ô∏è No. Atomic operations do not block other goroutines. They‚Äôre lock-free and fast.

‚ùì Q2: If I use mutex, will it block rest goroutines?
üÖ∞Ô∏è Only the ones trying to enter the locked section. The rest of the code outside mu.Lock() runs independently.

So:

Mutex blocks only inside the critical section.

Atomic never blocks and allows all goroutines to run freely.

‚úÖ Recommendation
Use atomic when your critical section is just a single variable update.

Use mutex when you need to guard multiple related operations or shared state.

Let me know if you want to simulate this with a demo Go program or benchmark.
